Babel = JavaScript compiler
      =  translats other languages into JavaScript

When using Reactr, we don't use normal JavaScript
We use enhanced version of JavaScript = JSX = JavsScript XML
  = same as JavaScript, but we can write HTML directly in our JavaScript code.

Problem with JSX:
- Our web browser donesn't understand JSX
- Need to translate JSX into JavaScript.
- Babel = translate JSX into JavaScript.
    To use Babel, two steps:
        1. load the babel.js 
        2. we give the script element an type="text/babel"

=======================================================================

component  = a piece of the webiste

In React the component name must start with a capital letter.
JSX is m ore restric than normal HTML. All elements need a closing tag.

in React, each component name must start with a capital letter.

Here’s why:

React uses capital letters to tell the difference between HTML tags (like <div> or <button>) and your own components.

If you start a component name with a lowercase letter, React will think it’s a built-in HTML element and won’t render your component correctly.


Main idea of React:
We can create our own HTML elements.

React lets us split our website into small pieces.(This let us work on small piece of the webiste at a time)

Fragment(<></>), avoid of introducing extra <div>

State = data that is connected to the HTML
When we updaet this data, it will update the HTML
